DESCRIPTION OF TASK

The Chat Application project demonstrates the use of Java Socket Programming and Multithreading to build a real-time communication system. Communication applications form the backbone of today’s digital interactions, and this project showcases how multiple users can connect and interact simultaneously through a centralized server.

The system consists of two main components: a Server that manages connections and broadcasts messages, and multiple Clients that connect to the server to exchange messages. Each client runs in a separate thread, allowing simultaneous communication without interruptions.

Key functionalities of the application include:

Multi-Client Support – Multiple clients can connect to the server and chat together in real-time.

Message Broadcasting – Any message sent by a client is delivered to all connected users instantly.

User Commands – Clients can use simple commands like /quit to exit the chat or /name to update their display name.

Join/Leave Notifications – The server notifies all users when someone joins or leaves the chat room.

Error Handling – Smoothly manages invalid inputs, connection errors, and client disconnections.

This project helps us understand:

How to establish client-server communication using Java Sockets.

The role of multithreading in handling multiple users simultaneously.

Techniques for message broadcasting and synchronization.

The importance of error handling in network-based applications.

By completing this project, interns gain practical knowledge of real-time communication systems, which are fundamental for building applications like chat rooms, collaborative tools, and messaging platforms.
